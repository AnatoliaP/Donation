<h1>Dear BCH Family,</h1><h1>I guess I came to final decision to knock on your door and swallow pride rather than to steal, rob or become a prostitute and risk lives of my kids.</h1><h1>I have borrow some money from friend to post here in hope that someone will find in heart to help because so many people tip generously and I hope someone will help me too</h1><h1>I am now writing from my friend computer just to appeal to people to help me in my very difficult time of need.</h1><h1>Behind this laughter and friendliness is a person who is sad, hopeless and struggling with raising 3 kids as a single mom here in Manila.</h1><h1>That is why I work very hard online for odd jobs and reviewing calls because I know that I have a big problem that I need to solve.</h1><h1>I do not have a family or any support here and the only reason why my kids and me are here in Manila is because of my business that my family have now stolen.</h1><h1>My ex husband's family has stolen my sales and all my stocks and this why I become like this and am on verge of homelessness.</h1><h1>My online income does not even cover the daily needs and there are days when all of us go to sleep hungry.</h1><h1>Both mine kids are sick too now. My three year old son with chicken pox and fever and I dont have money for medication either.</h1><h1>I feel like a useless mother cant take care of kids but I believe he has a strong body and he will be safe.&nbsp;</h1><h1><br></h1><h1><img src="https://i.imgur.com/azjEn89.jpg"></h1><p><br></p><h1><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SmEkxe7.jpg"></h1><p><br></p><h1>My 1 and half year old daughter is not yet fully recover from her chicken pox too.&nbsp;</h1><h1>My eldest daughter has leave me again and run to her father for the second time because she know how hopeless my situation is</h1><h1>She know that there is no food here and soon I will be kicked out from this room that we are renting because I have not payed 3 month of rent&nbsp;</h1><h1>It is very painful when your children lose faith in you but she forget all that I have done to sustain her needs.
